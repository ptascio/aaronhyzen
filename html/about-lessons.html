      <p>My Philosophy</p>

      <p>
      Every student is different and everyone has different musical goals. My
      approach is to help students meet their goals and guide them through the
      hurdles as they come up. The endgame for all of my students is to reach
      a place where they can continue to learn and grow without necessarily
      taking lessons. In short, we will try to achieve a technical level which
      allows you to learn, play and write the music you want to.

      <p><u>FAQ's</u></p>

      <i><u>Do I need to learn how to read music?</u></i>

      <p>
      Not necessarily. If your goals include playing J.S. Bach, then you are
      going to be reading some sheet music. If you want to play “Back in
      Black” by ACDC, you probably won’t be reading sheet music. However, I
      think learning to read music has other benefits such as getting
      comfortable with rhythms and finding a steady time feel.

      <i><u>I am interested in playing Rock/Blues/Pop..etc music, what now?</u></i>

      <p>
        The three main ways to learn Rock/Pop music are by ear, sheet music or
        Tabs/chord charts. Learning by ear is certainly the best way, but also
        takes the most effort. Why? Because when you learn a song by ear you’ll
        probably never forget it, learning by ear is the most effective way to
        internalize music. Typically, I use a combination of learning by ear and
         using Tabs/Chord charts. Tabs and chord charts can be great ways of
        learning frustrating parts and getting difficult passages. However
        Tabs/Chord charts from the internet can be and often are, wrong! It is
        important to use your ears when working with non-published Tabs or Chord
        charts.

      <i><u>How much should I be practicing and how often should I take lessons?</u></i>

      <p>
        It is very important to practice as often as possible. It is far more important to practice a little
        everyday than to practice in long blocks. For instance, a student is
        better off practicing 20 minutes a day than 2 hours once on the weekend.
        I always encourage my students to practice as often as possible and
        avoid the long, frustrating marathon practice sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as lessons go, I believe it is best to take lessons on a weekly
        basis. It is sometimes hard to express this to students because I am the
        guy selling lessons (talk about a conflict of interests). But it is
        really for a student’s benefit to stay consistent and focused. A typical
        situation is: “The week flew by and I didn’t have any time to practice.
        I don’t need a lesson this week, I’ll practice hard and next week I’ll
        take a lesson.” Unfortunately this is the quickest way to get off track
        (out of sight, out of mind). Getting results is important for
        re-enforcing motivation. The weeks do go by fast but so do the months. Without some regularity it is very difficult to get positive results.
        Before you know it you could be off the wagon and to some extent you’ll
        be starting over.

      <i><u>Do I need to <strong>Stretch Out</strong> before I <strong>Rock Out</strong>?!</u></i>

      <p>
        Well, it is always good to warm up first. Especially if you’re going be
        playing behind your head, doing windmills or the one-legged hop.
        Regardless, recent studies by the American Medical Association have
        shown it is more important to stretch out AFTER  you rock out.
        Stretching while your muscles are cold can actually cause more injuries.
