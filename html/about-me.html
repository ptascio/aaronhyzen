        In the summer of 2003 Aaron moved to New York City to study jazz and
        improvisation. He attended classes at City College of New York and
        studied extensively with some of New Yorkâ€™s best jazz musicians
        including Bruce Arnold, Tony Moreno, Tim Berne, John Patitucci and the
        great Brazilian percussionist Duduka de Fonseca. While at City College,
        he earned the Ben Jablonsky Award for excellence in jazz
        composition/arranging and a Pro Musica Certificate for excellence in
        scholarship and service. Aaron graduated Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from CCNY with a
        B.F.A. in Jazz Studies.

        Aaron has many diverse musical interests besides jazz. He draws from many
        years of experience playing various musical forms including blues, funk,
        rock, R&amp;B, reggae, and Brazilian styles. Aaron has also begun to
        pursue his interest in classical concert music and electronic music
        (reminiscent of Bjork). These days he plays rock music in a band, son.
