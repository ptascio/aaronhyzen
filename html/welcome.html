        Thanks for visiting my site, I have a bunch of info here about the lessons I offer
and the FREE chord workbook. Finding a good guitar teacher can be a
difficult task; feeling comfortable, open and relaxed with someone
you’ve just met is hard! But it is also important if you’re going to
have fun and learn something new as well. I have a great deal of
experience playing and teaching in New York. I’ve played all kinds of
music from Brazilian to Country Blues in venues from CBGB’s to the Blue
Note Jazz Club. I am open to all styles and I am always interested in
finding something new. I try to foster a laid back atmosphere where we
can connect and explore music together. Right now with your first lesson
 I’ll give you a FREE chord workbook. If you are interested in more info
 the pages that follow have more details, but you can also drop me a
line and we can talk directly.

        Cheers,
